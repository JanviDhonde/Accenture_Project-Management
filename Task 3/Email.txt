Subject: Qualities of a good project manager

Hi David,

As promised, sharing some suggested qualities that you might look for in an ideal project manager candidate.

A project manager is one who:

can interact well with others (interpersonal skills)
listens well and asks good questions (active listening)
is organized
can plan out at a high level and down to the lowest levels
is able to communicate with those doing to work to understand the work, progress, and hurdles
is able to communicate with those outside of the project succinctly and confidently
can facilitate meetings, workshops, and events
is able to get others to communicate and knows when to back away

Subject knowledge is a bonus, but the aforementioned are more important when selecting a project manager from your organization.

I hope this helps, please let me know if you have any further questions.

Kind regards,
your name
